Predicting Performance through Regression, kNN, Classification and Clustering Models

This project applies advanced data science techniques to predict tennis match outcomes.

Task 1 involved data preparation, where the primary dataset from Project 1 was cleaned and supplemented with additional data on players' age, height, weight, and ace_win performance metrics. Following this, exploratory data analysis was conducted to understand the data and identify underlying patterns.

In task 2, feature engineering was performed. A new target variable, "previous_winning_performance," was created based on the data, designed to improve the accuracy of the predictive models.

Task 3 comprised the development of predictive models using simple and multiple linear regression techniques, among others. The models' performance will be analyzed to unveil valuable insights about tennis match outcomes, potentially influencing future strategies and decisions in the sport.

In summary, this project represents a rigorous application of data science methodologies to tennis data, with the goal of predicting game outcomes and extracting insights that could have a significant impact on the player's performance.
